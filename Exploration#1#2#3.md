# **Exploration**              [^1]

## 1. Get a tool to f**k the GFW.           <u>Sep.7th</u>

​       Luckily, I have a wonderful roommate. Via his help, I got a cheap and steady ladder easily and started my trip to the hall of  Jo Tang.   

  (I didn't realize it's a big challenge absolutely at that time!!!)

## 2. Create a local Git .            <u>Sep.9th</u>

​      This step hindered me the longest time unexpectedly.   

​      During the copying[^2] process, the first question I need to solve is what this picture shows:

I noticed, I failed to connect my local bank with github anyway, and this problem disrupted my exploration for a long time[^3]  . By the way ,my roommate also met this same problem ,so we thought that the problem is that course reasonably.  To manage it, we searched for plenty of forums and answers about it on multiple websites. Unfortunately, we had got nothing useful and this dilemma was unable to conquer.      

When we asked our neighbors for help , we surprisingly knew that they was facing the same problem like us. Given that, I was determined to restart my whole procedures and tried to get key information from various resources. 

Eventually, I noticed these points: 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Charles-Google/sharuan/picture/img/202209141102858.png" style="zoom: 50%;" />

point one and point two implied a uniform question: I didn't have a correct SSH key to connect my github, but after costing me for a long time, I didn't have any progress at all. For instance, From several  methods on CSDN, I changed my hosts document, switched my port from 22 to 443, relink my SSH key by another way, and attempted to change my config document by vim editor and so on. Two points lead to point three, that means I failed completely.

So, after thinking a little time, I was determined to restart my whole procedure because I considered that maybe this mistake arose from these methods which were from different websites combined to a novel result. Different from the first time, I now have a neat train of thought. Surprisingly, I achieve it fluently without any trouble. This is my whole operation in the end as follows.

What makes me feel odd is that I can't realize this process on my roommate's computer again.[^4]  


# 3. A feasible Linux environment         <u>Sep.11th</u>
 Following senior schoolmate's advice, I chose the WSL between WSL and virtual machine. Resembling former step, I also meet some tough troubles that I can't overcome anyhow. These are my record about it.

The process runs normally at first until this problem occurs.

What makes me feel annoyed is that I can't get any relative information from the Internet to manage it. Given that former situation, I think I should change a version. So I delete that old version and get a new one. Regrettably, a new question is exposed.

After a lengthy information collection, I know I need this.

OK! now I only have a tiny trouble, which is I appear to input a strange name and a password that I don't remember. But I seemingly succeed anyhow.

Changing various files and executing plenty of commands...

Damn it! A new problem occurs. I am unable to make a connection successfully.

Fortunately after changing my IP address ,this problem is solved. Next

​                           **It is dead?!!!!!**

Eventually, I restart this whole process as before. Making a fresh start is a incredibly good way to solve computer problem in some way. These are successful pictures taken by my cell in that I am unable to use shortcut key in Linux.

It is too unexpected to finish this task without any mistake.

But I consider that the SSH key for logging in without password is unnecessary, it doesn't matter.   

# 4. My feeling and harvest   <u>Sep.12th</u>

This is my first time to know that ability to self-study and gather information is terribly vital in that no one has responsibility to take care of you and give you an arranged direction. I only can depend on myself and enhance my competence. 

In other wise, I also appreciate that having a clear train of thought is the most important thing to tackle trouble and debug. By the way, restart is a universal method to any mistake in some way.   —_—||

[^1]: Because changing my input method again and again has driven me crazy mostly and I also want to suit the full English environment in advance.(My English needs more practice indeed.)
[^2]: It means following the course on the Internet.
[^3]: About 2 days >_<
[^4]: Unbelievable !!!!
